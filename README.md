pyN(euron)
===

pyN (pronounced 'pine') Neuron(s)-based library in Python using numpy and Blender Game Engine.

I implemented this simulator completely from scratch. While there are certainly good simulators out there like NEURON and Genesis, it would have taken me just as long to fully understand those, compared to just implementing the models and equatiosn in the first place by myself.

pyN's functionality is straightforward:

  - create some populations. These are a group of neurons with the same properties.
  - join them together in a netwok
  - run the network
